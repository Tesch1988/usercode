(1) Checkout UserCode/aachen3a/ACSusyAnalysis in <CMSSW>/src,
    then mv UserCode/aachen3a aachen3a (IMPORTANT !).
    Compile everything using 
      scramv1 b -j4
    as usual.
(2) Modify the ACSkim_cfg*py files:
      - is_SHERPA = cms.bool(True) if running on SHERPA samples
      - Change the Jet Energy Correction - if necessary.
      - Edit skimming cuts
(3) Goto /test directory. Prepare submission to crab.
    Please change also hardcoded things like dcache 
    directory, email and black/white list.
    Then use prepare.sh to create a directory CRAB-<tag>-<version>.
    Just type
    ./prepare.sh
    for help.
    
    If running on QCD you may want to make sure that samples
    do not overlap. This can also be configured via ./prepare.sh.
(4) Just change to this directory, do
    crab -create and crab -submit
(5) Wait until the job has finished, and check, if the output
    is acceptable. Use
    ./counter.sh <user> <version> <tag>



That's it !
