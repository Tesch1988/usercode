(1) Checkout UserCode/aachen3a/ACSusyAnalysis in <CMSSW>/src,
    then mv UserCode/aachen3a aachen3a (IMPORTANT !).
    Compile everything using 
      scramv1 b
    as usual.
(2) Modify the ACSkim_cfg*py files:
      - is_SHERPA = cms.bool(True) if running on SHERPA samples
      - Change process.GlobalTag.globaltag = cms.string('STARTUP31X_V1::All')
        to the tag used for production, e.g. IDEAL_V11.
      - Change the HLT trigger name - if necessary. 
(3) Goto /test directory. Prepare submission to crab.
    First inform yourself about the actual crab server
    and change the server name in prepare.sh if necessary.
    Please change also other hardcoded things like dcache 
    directory, email and black/white list.
    Then call
    ./prepare.sh <datasetpath> <version> <tag>
    This will create a directory CRAB-<tag>-<version>
    if there are no error messages.
    
    If running on QCD you *must* make sure that samples
    do not overlap. This can also be configured via ./prepare.sh:
    ./prepare.sh <datasetpath> <version> <tag> <reco|pat> <pthat_low> <pthat_high>
(4) Just change to this directory, do
    crab -create and crab -submit
(5) Wait until the job has finished, and check, if the output
    is acceptable. Use
    ./counter.sh <version> <tag>
    You have to fix the paths in the helper script mysrmls.



That's it !
