(1) Checkout UserCode/aachen3a/ACSusyAnalysis in <CMSSW>/src,
    then mv UserCode/aachen3a aachen3a (IMPORTANT !).
    Compile everything using 
      scramv1 b
    as usual.
(2) Goto /test directory. Prepare submission to crab:
    ./prepare.sh <datasetpath> <version> <tag>
    You might have to edit prepare.sh because there
    are some hardcoded things set 
    (like my dcms directory and email, or black/white list)
    This will create a directory CRAB-<tag>-<version>
    if there are no error messages.
(3) Just change to this directory, do
    crab -create and crab -submit
(4) Wait until the job has finished, and check, if the output
    is acceptable. Use
    ./counter.sh <version> <tag>
   You have to fix the paths in the helper script mysrmls.

Modify
   is_SHERPA = cms.bool(False),
if running on SHERPA.

Do NOT forget to change
  process.GlobalTag.globaltag = cms.string('IDEAL_V9::All')
to the tag used for production, e.g. IDEAL_V11 !
So do not ignore the warning from ./prepare.sh :-)



That's it !
