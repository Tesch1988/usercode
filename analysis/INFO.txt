(1) Edit analysis code in SUSYAna.cpp and header SUSYAna.h
(2) make
(3) ./RunSUSY -in     <inputfile> -out <outputfile> -type <data|mc|signal> [ -debug ] 
    ./RunSUSY -inlist <inputlist> -out <outputfile> -type <data|mc|signal> [ -debug ]

If the content of the root tuple changes, one has to
recreate TreeContent.h. This is rather easy:

(1) open root file in root
(2) ACSkimAnalyis->cd()
(3) allData->MakeClass("TreeContent")
(4) change by hand array sizes [due to bug in MakeClass]


That's it !
