(1) Edit analysis code in SUSYAna.cpp and header SUSYAna.h
(2) make
(3) ./RunSUSY -inlist <inlist> -out <outfile>  [-debug]
    ./RunSUSY -in <filename>   -out <outfile>  [-debug]

If the content of the root tuple changes, one has to
recreate TreeContent.h. This is rather easy:

(1) open root file in root
(2) ACSkimAnalyis->cd()
(3) allData->MakeClass("TreeContent")
(4) change by hand array sizes [due to bug in MakeClass]


That's it !
