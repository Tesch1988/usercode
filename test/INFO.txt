(1) To compile SusyACSkimAnalysis.cpp use
      scramv1 b
    as usual.
(2) Prepare submission to crab:
    ./prepare.sh <datasetpath> <version> <tag>
    You might have to edit prepare.sh because there
    are some hardcoded things set 
    (like my dcms directory and email, or black/white list)
    This will create a directory CRAB-<tag>-<version>
(3) Just change to this directory, do
    crab -create and crab -submit
(4) Wait until the job has finished, and check, if the output
    is acceptable. Use
    ./counter.sh <version> <tag>

Do NOT forget to change
  process.GlobalTag.globaltag = cms.string('IDEAL_V9::All')
to the tag used for production, e.g. IDEAL_V11 !


That's it !
