Readme for Reskimmer
====================

First, edit the program Analysis.cxx to incorporate your cuts. Look for the
text "Start here implementing your cuts" for the right place. You can put cuts
on any arbitrary variables which are in the tree. It is also good to create a
few control histograms for the variables you are cutting on. 

Then, build the Reskimmer by issuing at the command prompt

make clean
make

Then, for submitting your jobs, issue the following command:

./reskim.py output/v7-8/ttjets /tmp/test/

where output/v7-8/ttjets is a directory on dcache relative to your user area,
e.g. relative to
"/pnfs/physik.rwth-aachen.de/cms/store/user/[your-user-id]". This directory
should contain all your input files (.root files) that the Skimmer has
produced.

The reskimmer will then join each 20 files (configure with "-m" switch) and
skim the input files with the cuts that you programmed. The output will be
stored in the directory "/tmp/test". Currently ROOT does not allow to store
files on dCache when authorisation (certificates) are required. If you want to
have your output files on dCache, you need to use srmmkdir+srmcp or uberftp
for the transfer.

If you need help on further options, issue ./reskim.py --help
