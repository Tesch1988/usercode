Readme for Reskimmer
====================

First, edit the program Analysis.cxx to incorporate your cuts. Look for the
text "Start here implementing your cuts" for the right place. You can put cuts
on any arbitrary variables which are in the tree. It is also good to create a
few control histograms for the variables you are cutting on. 

Then, build the Reskimmer by issuing at the command prompt

make clean
make

Then, for submitting your jobs, issue the following command:

./reskim.py output/v7-8/ttjets /tmp/test/

where output/v7-8/ttjets is a directory on dcache relative to your user area,
e.g. relative to
"/pnfs/physik.rwth-aachen.de/cms/store/user/[your-user-id]". This directory
should contain all your input files (.root files) that the Skimmer has
produced.

The reskimmer will then join each 20 files (configure with "-m" switch) and
skim the input files with the cuts that you programmed. The output will be
stored in the directory "/tmp/test". Currently ROOT does not allow to store
files on dCache when authorisation (certificates) are required. If you want to
have your output files on dCache, you need to use srmmkdir+srmcp or uberftp
for the transfer.

Once your jobs finish, you can use the program collect.py to check your
log files and resubmit failed jobs. Issue the program like this:

./collect.py /tmp/test

where /tmp/test is the output directory of the reskim job (same as above). The
log files are checked. Warnings are being printed. If errors are encountered,
the jobs are resubmitted. Jobs are also resubmitted if the program did not
terminate correctly.

If you need help on further options, issue ./reskim.py --help or 
./collect.py --help, respectively.

PDF-weights:
To use the reskimmer to get pdf-weights for different PDF-sets use the -p option
of ./reskim.py to choose a PDF-set which will be used to calculate the PDF-weights.
The default value is 'data' which means no PDF-weights are calculated. The other
options are 'cteq6ll' and 'CT10'. The weights are calculated for three PDF-sets:
'NNPDF22_nlo_100','MSTW2008nlo68cl' and 'CT10'. This can be changed in 'Analysis.cxx'.
Important is to always do:
'export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/.automount/net_rw/net__scratch_cms/institut_3a/erdweg/LHAPDF/lib'
without that the PDF-weight calculation will not work.

deactivation of Branches:
If you want to deactivate some Branches of the skimmer output, modify 'reskim.cxx' 'void deactivateBranches'.
Default is everything activated.
